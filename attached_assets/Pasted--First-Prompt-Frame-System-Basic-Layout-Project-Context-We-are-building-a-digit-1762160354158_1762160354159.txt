**First Prompt - Frame System & Basic Layout:**

---

**Project Context:**  
We are building a digital scrapbook layout in a React/TypeScript component (`memorybook.tsx`). The current layout is a simple alternating left-right list. We want to transform it into a visually rich, collage-style long image.

**Current Task (Part 1/3): Implement the Diverse Frame System & Basic Asymmetric Layout**

**Requirements:**

1. **Create CSS classes for at least 4 distinct photo frames:**
   - `.polaroid-frame`: White background, internal padding, extra space at the bottom (for caption), subtle shadow.
   - `.torn-edge-frame`: Simulates a torn paper edge (using CSS `mask-image` or a background image for the torn effect).
   - `.scotch-tape-frame`: Uses `::before` and/or `::after` pseudo-elements to create semi-transparent "tape" pieces on the top-left and top-right corners of the image.
   - `.regular-photo`: A standard rounded corner image but with a slight random rotation applied.

2. **Establish a basic asymmetric CSS Grid layout:**
   - The container should use CSS Grid.
   - Define a grid template that allows for overlapping and non-uniform placement (e.g., some items span multiple rows/columns).
   - Incorporate a gentle, random rotation (-3deg to +3deg) for each photo item to avoid a rigid look.
   - Plan for a vertical, long-scroll container.

3. **Technical Constraints:**
   - Must work within the existing React/TypeScript environment.
   - Use inline styles or CSS classes applied via JSX for dynamic properties like rotation.
   - Ensure the final structure can be captured correctly by `html2canvas` (avoid complex CSS that might not render to canvas properly).

**Expected Output:**
- Provide the modified HTML (JSX) structure for the scrapbook container and photo items.
- Provide the corresponding CSS styles (either as a stylesheet or JSX inline styles) for the frame classes and the grid layout.
- The photos should be placed in an interesting, non-linear arrangement.

**Please proceed by generating the necessary JSX and CSS code to achieve this first part.**
